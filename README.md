<h1>ECE 422L - Computer Organization and Design Lab</h1>


<h2>Student: Antonio Anzora Jr</h2>
<h2>Professor: Aaron Nanas</h2>

This repository will contain all labs for this class located here. This repository is intended to help students and verify there knowledge of Computer Organization and Design.

<h3>Course Description: </h3>

This course covers RISC-based computer instruction set architecture (ISA). Computer performance. It includes the design of a datapath and control path for the RISC CPUs, as well as single-cycle, multi-cycle, and pilined processor designs. The course also explores the design of key computer hardware modules such as arithmetic-logic units (ALUs), control units, input-output units, and buses. Additionally, it examines memory hierarchy and organization, including cache and virtual memory management.
